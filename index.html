    <h1>JavaScript Let's You to...</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>be interactive with your website            
        </li>
        <li>create calculators</li>
        <li>add movements to objects</li>
    </ol>
<h1>Things to know about JavaScript...</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>+ is for addition </li>
        <li>- is for subtraction </li>
        <li>/ backslash is for divide </li>
        <li>* is for multiply</li>
        <li>% is for modulus division</li>
    </ul>
 <p>There are a few command words we need to discuss. We have the following command words:
        <ul>
            <li>document: refers to the current document</li>
            <li>getElementByID: allows us to grab an element on the webpage based on the id</li>
            <li>textContent: allows us to change the text content within an element</li>
            <li>function: allows us to save code for later</li>
            <li>value: allows us to grab or set the value of a form element</li>
            <li>let: allows us to create a variable</li>
            <li>onclick: is an event that occurs when the user clicks something on the page</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>You may be wondering why a Dino lodging site is trying to tell you about JavaScript. Good questions. The universe is a complex place, and one can't really know. Just go with it. Sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to what we do. Humans are silly, and we are doing our best. Have a great day!</p>
